## Our plan for the week {.smaller}

```{r setup}
pacman::p_load(
  knitr,
  tidyverse, 
  countdown)
```

1.  Automatable reports

2.  Version control

3.  Dissemination and academic websites

4.  Containerisation for reproducible environments

5.  **Encryption and advanced research infrastructure**

## What did we do in the last part?

-   **Containerisation for reproducible environments**

::: notes
:::

# Part 5: Encryption and advanced research infrastructure {background-color="aquamarine"}

-   Part I: Encryption of files (with Veracrypt)
-   Part II: Encryption of e-mails (with PGP)
-   Bonus: Advanced research infrastructure

## Any questions from the readings?

-   Compulsory reading:
    -   Rahal. 2017. [An Introduction to the Command Line](https://crahal.github.io/teaching/AnIntroductionToTheCommandLine).
    -   VeraCrypt. [Documentation](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Documentation.html).
-   Suggested reading:
    -   The Carpentries: [Extra Unix Shell Material](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/shell-extras/).
    -   The Carpentries: [Introduction to the Command Line for Metagenomics](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/shell-metagenomics/).

# Part I: Encryption {background-color="aquamarine"}

## Encryption - why in a context of open science?

::: fragment
-   to comply with data protection regulations.

-   to comply with ethics protocols.

-   to protect human subjects of research.

-   to prevent data theft.
:::

## Tools

::: fragment
-   Veracrypt
-   7-Zip
-   Bitlocker (Windows)
-   FileVault (Mac)
-   LastPass
:::

## Veracrypt

-   Container in Veracrypt =/ Container in Docker

-   Creates a virtual encrypted disk within a folder

-   Encrypts a storage device such as a USB or hard drive.

-   Several encryption options

## Veracrypt: hacks

-   Favourites + open explorer automatically

-   Conflicting copies: solving issues with shared drives\
    --\> delete online and sync again

# Lab Session I üë©‚Äçüíª üë®‚Äçüíª {background-color="#f3e2b4"}

-   Use Veracrypt to create an encrypted file container to store **a copy** of your UCL/NCRM course material.

    -   Attention: create a new container, do not select an existing folder with files inside.
    -   Use the AES encryption algorythm. You need to hoover around with your cursor to encrypt the file.

-   Open the container and access your data via a separate disk.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| cache: false
countdown(minutes = 25, font_size = "1.5em")
```

# Part II: Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) for communication {background-color="aquamarine"}

Why use encryption?

- Security
- Personal Privacy
- Privacy Laws


## Asymetrical Encryption

- public key
  - can be sent anywhere
  - is used to encrypt messeges
- private key
  - should be kept on your computer at all times
  - is used to decrypt messages


# Lab Session II üë©‚Äçüíª üë®‚Äçüíª {background-color="#f3e2b4"}

- Create a PGP key and send an encrypted message

## Create The Keys {background-color="#f3e2b4" .smaller}

- Download [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/de/download/)
- Add a mail account
- Go to Account > End-to-End Encryption > OpenPGP > Add Key 
  - Create keys with default settings
- Click Publish
- You should get an email from keyserver@keys.openpgp.org
- Click on the confirmation link in the email

## Send an encrypted message to yourself {background-color="#f3e2b4"}

- click "New Message"
- After entering your own email as a recipient you should see a "encrypt" button appear
- Add a sentence and send the message


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| cache: false
countdown(minutes = 25, font_size = "1.5em")
```
